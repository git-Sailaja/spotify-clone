# Spotify Clone using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Spotify Clone web application** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to replicate the core user interface and basic music playback functionality of a real-world music streaming platform.  
The goal of this project is to practice front-end development skills and demonstrate an understanding of UI design, interactivity, and client-side logic.


## Project Description
The application allows users to interact with a simple music player interface that includes playback controls and dynamic UI updates.  
This project emphasizes JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and responsive design rather than backend or database integration.


## Tools and Technologies
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Browser Audio API  

## Features Implemented
The following features were implemented in this project:

- Play and pause music functionality  
- Next and previous track controls  
- Dynamic progress bar with real-time updates  
- Interactive song list with active track indication  
- Responsive and user-friendly interface  

## Key Learnings
- Understanding JavaScript-based audio playback  
- DOM manipulation for dynamic UI updates  
- Implementing interactive controls using JavaScript  
- Designing responsive layouts using CSS  
- Structuring front-end projects effectively  


## Files Included
- `index.html` – Main structure of the application  
- `style.css` – Styling and layout design  
- `script.js` – JavaScript logic for music playback and interactivity  
- `playing.gif` – Visual indicator for active playback  


## Project Purpose
This project is created as a **learning and portfolio project** to strengthen front-end development skills.  
The same concepts applied here can be extended to more advanced web applications with additional features and backend integration.
